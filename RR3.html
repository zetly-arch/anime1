        During the mission rin was abducted by the enemy, while Kakashi and Obito were on a mission to resque her. During the mission, Obito saved Kakashi from a falling rock, sacrificing himself in the process.
        And Obito gave his Sharingan to Kakashi as a final gift, which is why Kakashi is known as the Copy Ninja.
        Obito's last words to Kakashi were "you're my light "and you will always be my light.
        After Obito's death, Kakashi vowed to honor his friend's memory and protect the village, becoming a key figure in the fight against the Akatsuki and other threats.
        But Obito was not dead, he was alive and became the leader of Akatsuki, and he was manipulating everything from behind the scenes which led to the Fourth Great Ninja War.
        This all happened because Kakashi had to kill Rin, who was a Jinchuriki of the Three Tails, to prevent the tailed beast from being unleashed on the world.
        Obito was devastated by Rin's death, believing that Kakashi had betrayed him. But the truth was that Rin had sacrificed herself to protect the village and her friends.
        And this truth was manipulated by Madara Uchiha, who was the true mastermind behind the events of the Fourth Great Ninja War.
